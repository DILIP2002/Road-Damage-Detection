# Road-Damage-Detection
#abstract
<H4>Automated road damage detection (RDD) is vital for infrastructure maintenance and safety. This study evaluates the performance of YOLO-based deep learning algorithms (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) in detecting road damages from UAV images. Using the RDD2022 dataset, precision, recall, F-score, and accuracy metrics are measured for each algorithm. YOLOv7 exhibits superior performance compared to YOLOv5, achieving a precision of 85.80percent
recall of 78.99Percent and  F-measure of 79.85Percent, and accuracy of 82.5percent. Notably, YOLOv8, with increased model complexity, yields even higher accuracy, boasting a precision score of 92Percent, recall rate of 79.70percent, F-measure of 82.33Percent, and an average accuracy level of 85 percent.

This research underscores the efficacy of deep learning techniques, particularly when combined with YOLO-based approaches, in automating tasks related to road damage detection. By leveraging these advanced algorithms, transportation authorities can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure maintenance processes, thereby improving road safety and reducing maintenance costs. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential of deep learning technologies to revolutionize road maintenance practices and contribute to the development of more reliable and sustainable transportation systems.</H4>

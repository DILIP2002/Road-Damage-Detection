# Road-Damage-Detection
# Abstract
<H4>Automated road damage detection (RDD) is vital for infrastructure maintenance and safety. This study evaluates the performance of YOLO-based deep learning algorithms (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) in detecting road damages from UAV images. Using the RDD2022 dataset, precision, recall, F-score, and accuracy metrics are measured for each algorithm. YOLOv7 exhibits superior performance compared to YOLOv5, achieving a precision of 85.80percent
recall of 78.99Percent and  F-measure of 79.85Percent, and accuracy of 82.5percent. Notably, YOLOv8, with increased model complexity, yields even higher accuracy, boasting a precision score of 92Percent, recall rate of 79.70percent, F-measure of 82.33Percent, and an average accuracy level of 85 percent.

This research underscores the efficacy of deep learning techniques, particularly when combined with YOLO-based approaches, in automating tasks related to road damage detection. By leveraging these advanced algorithms, transportation authorities can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure maintenance processes, thereby improving road safety and reducing maintenance costs. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential of deep learning technologies to revolutionize road maintenance practices and contribute to the development of more reliable and sustainable transportation systems.</H4>

# Introduction 
<H4>Automated detection of road damage (RDD) is a must for any safe and efficient transport system. Over time, roads disintegrate due to weather conditions such as rain or snow, traffic use and age among others; therefore it is important that these damages are detected early enough so they can be fixed before causing accidents or disruptions. So far, the development and refinement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) coupled with improved deep learning approaches like YOLO (You Only Look Once) have greatly enhanced the efficiency and precision of detecting damages on roads (Tan et al., 2018). 
YOLO which stands for You Only Look Once is a famous object detection algorithm used in many computer vision tasks because it can locate objects instantly while also classifying them in real-time (2016). By examining photos taken from above by drones, YOLO algorithms can quickly identify different types of road damages including but not limited to cracks,potholes or surface deterioration thus prompting timely repairs. The aim of this report is to compare two versions of YOLO algorithms namely YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 when it comes down to recognizing road destruction from images captured through UAVs. We will be using RDD2022 dataset which provides diverse sets of pictures showing various scenarios where roads get damaged so as to evaluate each algorithm’s precision rate\recall rate\Fscore\accuracy rate. Also Liu et al.’s work about RDD2022 dataset has been very instrumental in training our models since we were able to test their performance more comprehensively(Liu et al., 2020). Additionally, we improve upon these findings by introducing an even more sophisticated model called YOLOv8. This new version utilizes recent advancements made within deep learning field thereby increasing predictive accuracy levels which means higher success rates for automated systems designed towards identifying faults along highways or any other transportation infrastructure facility.By conducting experiments based on real world situations, our main objective is to show how well YOLO-based models can automate detection of road damages thus enabling maintenance managers take necessary actions in time.</H4>
